A resume is a concise summary of education, skills, and work experience, crucial for making a strong first impression on employers. It showcases relevant qualifications tailored to the job, facilitating quick assessments. A portfolio, on the other hand, is a collection of work samples demonstrating skills and achievements, especially vital in creative and technical fields. It provides tangible proof of abilities and complements the resume by showcasing past work quality and scope. Both are indispensable tools for job applications, with the resume serving as a snapshot of qualifications and the portfolio offering concrete evidence of competence.
