A Printed Circuit Board (PCB) is a flat, rigid board that supports and electrically connects electronic components using conductive tracks, pads, and other features etched from copper sheets laminated onto a non-conductive substrate. PCBs are fundamental in the electronics industry, found in nearly all electronic devices, from simple gadgets to complex machinery.

Circuit Design from Tinkercad to EasyEDA:

Tinkercad is a beginner-friendly, web-based application for creating 3D designs, electronics simulations, and code blocks. It provides a virtual environment to design and simulate circuits without needing physical components, making it ideal for prototyping and learning. Users can create simple circuits using a drag-and-drop interface, simulating the behavior of the circuit before moving to the PCB design stage.

Steps in Tinkercad: Create a Circuit, Simulate the Circuit, Export the Design.

EasyEDA is an online PCB design tool that offers more advanced features for creating professional-grade PCBs. It allows users to import schematics, design multilayer PCBs, and generate Gerber files for manufacturing.

Steps in EasyEDA: Import Schematic, Design the PCB Layout, Run Design Rule Checks, Generate Gerber Files,Order the PCB

Advantages of PCBs: Compact Size and Efficiency, Reliability and Durability, Ease of Assembly and Mass Production, Reduced Wiring Errors, Enhanced Performance and Cost-Effective Production
